# Changelog

All notable changes to the **LabVIEW Benchmark Actor** extension are documented here. The format
follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) and the project uses
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [0.2.0] - 2026-07-30

### Added
- MCP tools: the extension contributes a **Model Context Protocol** server (a dependency-free stdio
  JSON-RPC server) exposing its own tools to Copilot agent mode — `get_host_capabilities`,
  `get_benchmark_series`, `poll_coordination_bus`, and `post_coordination_note`.
- Marketplace listing polish: extension icon, gallery banner, keywords, and `Visualization` / `Testing`
  categories.
- Marketplace publish: the `extension-release` workflow now publishes the built `.vsix` to the VS Code
  Marketplace (fork-safe, PAT-gated, fail-open) after the bidirectional WIN&harr;LINUX agreement gate, and
  guards the `.vsix` size so a non-runtime leak can never be released or published.

## [0.1.1]

### Added
- **Benchmark viewer** (`LabVIEW Benchmark Actor: Open Benchmark Viewer`) — renders the deterministic
  mprr ring-buffer metric series with a draggable time cursor, in a strict-CSP nonce-scoped webview.
- **Host capabilities** (`Show Host Capabilities`) and the **coordination bus** (`Poll Coordination Bus`,
  `Post Coordination Note`), backed by the `lbabus` CLI.
- **Extension-embedded agent instructions** — `Write` / `Show` / `Check Agent Instructions` materialize and
  drift-check a version-pinned `AGENTS.md` (sha256 over the canonical body).
- Prerequisite remediation surfaced when the `lbabus` coordination CLI is not installed.

### Notes
- The extension depends only on `vscode` + Node built-ins — no `vi-history-suite`-private module on its
  graph (LBA-REQ-001).
